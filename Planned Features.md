# Planned Features
This file contains planned feature additions.

## Short-term
This section contains features that will be added soon.

### Adding a file
Well, you can't organize file structures without files, so this one has top priority.

How it'll work (subject to change):
- Press an Add File button
- That will create a new row in the tree, with a file icon on the left (yet to be designed)
- A input field will get focus, into which the user should input the name and extension of the file
- When the user presses the `enter`/`return` key, the input will lose focus, and any changes to the file name will be committed.
